Question 3
=====================
>Write a program to find the given words from the included word search.

<br />

  I wrote a java class [wordSearch](https://github.com/d3dc/code-foo-2013/blob/master/q3/wordSearch.java). The class has methods to manipulate and solve the puzzle. This is wrapped in a simple command-line interface [WordSearchSolver](https://github.com/d3dc/code-foo-2013/blob/master/word-search/WordSearchSolver.java).  
<br />

    To compile: javac WordSearchSolver.java
    
    To run: java WordSearchSolver filename

<br />
A correct file has the format:
	 >The first part of the file contains a matrix of N rows and M columns. 
	 Letters in the same row are separated by a tab (\t). Each row is separated by a newline.
     <br />
     >The list of words to find is below the matrix, delineated by a blank line followed by "Words to find:".
