2. How many gamers are in the San Francisco Bay Area? Describe each step in your thought process.  
  
  The number of gamers is going to be some subset of the total population. From [Bay Area Census *via Wikipedia*](http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/bayarea.htm):
                                                                    
  - The Total population of the San Francisco Bay Area is: **7.15 million people**
  - Whom comprise **2,608,023 households**
 
  - According to [theesa.com](http://www.theesa.com/facts/), 72% of households play computer or video games.

In 2010:
  - The average household size was **2.69 people**

So:

  - 1,877,777 households play computer or videogames.
  - with 2.69 people per household thats 5,051,219 gamers.
  
**There are around 5 million gamers in the San Francisco area.**
